# Arknights Clock

![screenshoot](https://i.ibb.co/GFQyNBv/screenshoot-arknights-clock.png)

Hello👋, thanks for visiting this repository. This repository is a clock website that uses places from the [Arknights](https://www.arknights.global/) universe as the background images and displays some facts about the places shown. Background images will be displayed randomly based on time (morning, afternoon, evening, etc.).

**Preview : https://notokrs.github.io/arknights-clock/**

> **⚠️ NOTE ⚠️**
> This repository is still in the development stage and maybe the website does not display the background and facts of the places shown because the background images and data sources used are still very few.

If you have any questions or suggestions please contact me via email : notokrs@gmail.com or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/rusnoto098).
